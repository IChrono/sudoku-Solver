# Sudoku Solver

This is one of the exercises made during my React/Javascript learning journey.<br>
The goal was to find an algorithm from scratch that resolves a classic 9x9 Sudoku. <br>Unknowingly, I fell into what is called the "Backtracking algorithm," which simply keeps track of the choices made and, if a choice leads to a dead end, it backtracks to try another option.

## Features

When you load the page, you will find a ready to play board. <br>
You can:<br> - Run the solution by pressing "Solve Sudoku". <br> - "Pause" the solver while it's running. <br> - "Reset" to clear all the sudoku fields. <br> - Enter your own Sudoku puzzle to find its solution.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
